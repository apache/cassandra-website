* [DataStax Sink Connector](https://downloads.datastax.com/#akc): The DataStax Apache Kafka Connector automatically takes records from Kafka topics and writes them to a DataStax Enterprise or Apache Cassandra™ database. This sink connector is deployed in the Kafka Connect framework and removes the need to build a custom solution to move data between these two systems.

* [Lenses Sink Connector](https://docs.lenses.io/connectors/sink/cassandra.html): The Cassandra Sink allows you to write events from Kafka to Cassandra. The connector converts the value from the Kafka Connect SinkRecords to JSON and uses Cassandra’s JSON insert functionality to insert the rows. The task expects pre-created tables in Cassandra.

#### Apache Spark

* [DataStax Spark Cassandra Connector](https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector): This library lets you expose Cassandra tables as Spark RDDs and Datasets/DataFrames, write Spark RDDs and Datasets/DataFrames to Cassandra tables, and execute arbitrary CQL queries in your Spark applications.

#### Apache Flink

* [Flink Sink Connector](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/connectors/cassandra.html): This connector provides sinks that writes data into a Apache Cassandra database.
