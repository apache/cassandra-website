Introducing the first Cassandra Changelog blog―our monthly roundup of key activities and knowledge to keep the community informed. 

## Release Notes

#### ### Updated

The most current Apache Cassandra releases are 4.0-beta2, 3.11.8, 3.0.22, 2.2.18 and 2.1.22 released on August 31 and are [in the repositories](https://cassandra.apache.org/download/). The next cut of releases will be out soon―join the Cassandra [mailing list](https://cassandra.apache.org/community/) to stay up-to-date.

We continue to make progress toward the 4.0 GA release with the overarching goal of it being at a state where major users should feel confident running it in production when it is cut. Over 1,300 Jira tickets have been closed and [84 remain](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/CASSANDRA/versions/12346094) as of today. To gain this confidence, there are various ongoing testing efforts involving correctness, performance, and ease of use.

#### ### Added

With CASSANDRA-15013, the community improved Cassandra&#39;s ability to [handle high throughput workloads](https://cassandra.apache.org/blog/2020/09/03/improving-resiliency.html), while having enough safeguards in place to protect itself from potentially going out of memory.

#### ### Added

The [Harry project](https://github.com/apache/cassandra-harry/blob/master/README.md) aims to generate reproducible workloads that are as close to real-life as possible, while being able to efficiently verify the cluster state against the model without pausing the workload itself.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out Harry, a fuzz-testing tool for Apache Cassandra, the best way to test databases or storage engines you&#39;ve ever used: <a href="https://t.co/WjtkIMMrXp">https://t.co/WjtkIMMrXp</a></p>&mdash; αλεx π (@ifesdjeen) <a href="https://twitter.com/ifesdjeen/status/1308036563402719234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### ### Added

The community published its first [Apache Cassandra Usage Report](https://cassandra.apache.org/blog/2020/09/17/cassandra-usage-report-2020.html) detailing findings from a comprehensive global survey of 901 practitioners on Cassandra usage to provide a baseline understanding of who, how, and why organizations use Cassandra.

## Community Notes

_Updates on new and active Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs) and how to contribute._

#### ### Changed

[CEP-2: Kubernetes Operator](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-2+Kubernetes+Operator) was introduced this year and is an active discussion on creation of a community-based operator with the goal of making it easy to run Cassandra on Kubernetes.

#### ### Added

[CEP-7: Storage Attached Index (SAI)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-7%3A+Storage+Attached+Index) is a new secondary index for Cassandra that builds on the advancements made with SASI. It is intended to replace the existing built-in secondary index implementations.

#### ### Added

Cassandra was selected by the ASF Diversity &amp; Inclusion committee to be [included in a research project](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfa1673c9f8b42cf286f5fb763eb987eced2bdea1a619358869a49bef%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E) to evaluate and understand the current state of diversity.

## Userspace

**Bigmate**

&quot;In vetting MySQL, MongoDB, and other potential databases for IoT scale, we found they couldn&#39;t match the scalability we could get with open source Apache Cassandra. Cassandra&#39;s built-for-scale architecture enables us to handle millions of operations or concurrent users each second with ease – making it ideal for IoT deployments.&quot; - [Brett Orr](https://www.iotcentral.io/blog/how-open-source-apache-cassandra-solved-our-iot-scalability-and-r)

**Bloomberg**

&quot;Our group is working on a multi-year build, creating a new Index Construction Platform to handle the daily production of the Bloomberg Barclays fixed income indices. This involves building and productionizing an Apache Solr-backed search platform to handle thousands of searches per minute, an Apache Cassandra back-end database to store millions of data points per day, and a distributed computational engine to handle millions of computations daily.&quot; - [Pinky Dewani](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/meet-the-team-indices-engineering/)

## Get Started with Cassandra

A Cassandra user was in searech of a tool to perform schema DDL upgrades. Another user suggested [https://github.com/patka/cassandra-migration](https://github.com/patka/cassandra-migration) to ensure you don&#39;t get schema mismatches if running multiple upgrade statements in one migration. See the [full email](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdfee145c4c5d920f644c6bcd081c6fb446d52b055c133485217b8143%40%3Cuser.cassandra.apache.org%3E) on the user mailing list for other recommended tools.
