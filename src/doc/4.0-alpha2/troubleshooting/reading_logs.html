<span id="reading-logs"></span><h1>Cassandra Logs<a class="headerlink" href="#cassandra-logs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Cassandra has rich support for logging and attempts to give operators maximum
insight into the database while at the same time limiting noise to the logs.</p>
<div class="section" id="common-log-files">
<h2>Common Log Files<a class="headerlink" href="#common-log-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cassandra has three main logs, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">system.log</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">debug.log</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gc.log</span></code> which hold general logging messages, debugging logging messages, and
java garbage collection logs respectively.</p>
<p>These logs by default live in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${CASSANDRA_HOME}/logs</span></code>, but most Linux
distributions relocate logs to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/var/log/cassandra</span></code>. Operators can tune
this location as well as what levels are logged using the provided
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">logback.xml</span></code> file.</p>
<div class="section" id="system-log">
<h3><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">system.log</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#system-log" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This log is the default Cassandra log and is a good place to start any
investigation. Some examples of activities logged to this log:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Uncaught exceptions. These can be very useful for debugging errors.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GCInspector</span></code> messages indicating long garbage collector pauses. When long
pauses happen Cassandra will print how long and also what was the state of
the system (thread state) at the time of that pause. This can help narrow
down a capacity issue (either not enough heap or not enough spare CPU).</li>
<li>Information about nodes joining and leaving the cluster as well as token
metadata (data ownersip) changes. This is useful for debugging network
partitions, data movements, and more.</li>
<li>Keyspace/Table creation, modification, deletion.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartupChecks</span></code> that ensure optimal configuration of the operating system
to run Cassandra</li>
<li>Information about some background operational tasks (e.g. Index
Redistribution).</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any application, looking for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ERROR</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARN</span></code> lines can be a
great first step:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ # Search for warnings or errors in the latest system.log
$ grep &#39;WARN\|ERROR&#39; system.log | tail
...

$ # Search for warnings or errors in all rotated system.log
$ zgrep &#39;WARN\|ERROR&#39; system.log.* | less
...
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debug-log">
<h3><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">debug.log</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#debug-log" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This log contains additional debugging information that may be useful when
troubleshooting but may be much noiser than the normal <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">system.log</span></code>. Some
examples of activities logged to this log:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Information about compactions, including when they start, which sstables
they contain, and when they finish.</li>
<li>Information about memtable flushes to disk, including when they happened,
how large the flushes were, and which commitlog segments the flush impacted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This log can be <em>very</em> noisy, so it is highly recommended to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grep</span></code> and
other log analysis tools to dive deep. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ # Search for messages involving a CompactionTask with 5 lines of context
$ grep CompactionTask debug.log -C 5
...

$ # Look at the distribution of flush tasks per keyspace
$ grep &quot;Enqueuing flush&quot; debug.log | cut -f 10 -d &#39; &#39; | sort | uniq -c

<p>The gc log is a standard Java GC log. With the default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jvm.options</span></code>
settings you get a lot of valuable information in this log such as
application pause times, and why pauses happened. This may help narrow
down throughput or latency issues to a mistuned JVM. For example you can
view the last few pauses:</p>

was paused (meaning zero user queries were being serviced during the e.g. 33ms
JVM pause) as well as how long it took to enter the safepoint. You can use this

<p>In this case any client waiting on a query would have experienced a <cite>56ms</cite>
latency at 17:13:41.</p>
<p>Note that GC pauses are not _only_ garbage collection, although
generally speaking high pauses with fast safepoints indicate a lack of JVM heap
or mistuned JVM GC algorithm. High pauses with slow safepoints typically
indicate that the JVM is having trouble entering a safepoint which usually
indicates slow disk drives (Cassandra makes heavy use of memory mapped reads
which the JVM doesn’t know could have disk latency, so the JVM safepoint logic
doesn’t handle a blocking memory mapped read particularly well).</p>
<p>Using these logs you can even get a pause distribution with something like

is causing multi second JVM pauses … In this case it was mostly safepoint
pauses caused by slow disks:</p>

<p>Sometimes reading and understanding java GC logs is hard, but you can take the
raw GC files and visualize them using tools such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer">GCViewer</a> which take the Cassandra GC log as
input and show you detailed visual information on your garbage collection
performance. This includes pause analysis as well as throughput information.
For a stable Cassandra JVM you probably want to aim for pauses less than
<cite>200ms</cite> and GC throughput greater than <cite>99%</cite> (ymmv).</p>
<p>Java GC pauses are one of the leading causes of tail latency in Cassandra
(along with drive latency) so sometimes this information can be crucial
while debugging tail latency issues.</p>
