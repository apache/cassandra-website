![Apache Cassandra™ World Party banner](/img/world-party-2021-footer.png)

Apache Cassandra™ runs some of the biggest workloads around the world. Join our virtual, one-day celebration on **Wednesday, April 28, 2021** in preparation for
 the launch of 4.0, the most stable database release ever shipped. Fun, fast-paced talks from our global community will keep you entertained around the clock.

## Who

Anyone around the world! If you use and/or contribute to Cassandra, join us to meet others from the global community, learn, share, and celebrate.

## When

The one-day event will include three sessions so you can celebrate with the Cassandra community in your time zone or attend all three! **Registration link coming soon**.
- April 28 5:00am UTC
- April 28 1:00pm UTC
- April 28 9:00pm UTC

## What

Each session is an hour long and will feature fun, fast-paced lightning talks on Cassandra plus interactive content and some giveaways. All participants must adhere to the ASF’s [anti-harassment policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/anti-harassment.html).

### Call for Papers

We’re looking for fun, fast-paced, 5 minute “lightning” style talks that focus on:
x
- What you love about Cassandra
- Why you’re passionate about Cassandra
- What you’ve learned using Cassandra
- What you’ve built with Cassandra
- How you successfully scale applications with Cassandra

That’s it! We’ll even give you a deck with iconography you can use to get you started. Whether you're a beginner or long-time Cassandra user, come share your tale and learn from others. Submissions due by April 9.

We're also looking for people to help review talks and moderate -- if you're interested in participating, email [events@constantia.io](mailto:events@constantia.io).
