=== Reaper: Anti-entropy Repair Made Easy 
[discrete]
==== September 28, 2021
------
[openblock,card-content]
------
Originally designed by Spotify, Reaper is an open source written in Java to schedule and orchestrate repairs of Apache Cassandra clusters. It helps make repairs as safe and reliable as possible, and with the recent release of Apache Cassandra 4.0 that also includes incremental repairs.

Five operators for Apache Cassandra have been created that have made it easier to run containerized Cassandra on Kubernetes. Recently the major contributors to these operators came together to discuss the creation of a community-based operator with the intent of making one that makes it easy to run C* on K8s. One of the project’s organizational goals is that the end result will eventually become part of the Apache Software Foundation or the Apache Cassandra project.

This is the most stable Apache Cassandra in history; you should start using Apache Cassandra 4.0 Beta today in your test and QA environments, head to the downloads site to get your hands on it. The Cassandra community is on a mission to deliver a 4.0 GA release that is ready to be deployed to production. You can guarantee this holds true by running your application workloads against the Beta release and contributing to the community’s validation effort to get Cassandra 4.0 to GA.

===  Even Higher Availability with 5x Faster Streaming in Cassandra 4.0
[discrete]
==== April 09, 2019
------
[openblock,card-content]
------
Streaming is a process where nodes of a cluster exchange data in the form of SSTables. Streaming can kick in during many situations such as bootstrap, repair, rebuild, range movement, cluster expansion, etc. In this post, we discuss the massive performance improvements made to the streaming process in Apache Cassandra 4.0.

===  Introducing Transient Replication
[discrete]
==== December 03, 2018
------
[openblock,card-content]
------
Transient Replication is a new experimental feature soon to be available in 4.0. When enabled, it allows for the creation of keyspaces where replication factor can be specified as a number of copies (full replicas) and temporary copies (transient replicas). Transient replicas retain the data they replicate only long enough for it to be propagated to full replicas, via incremental repair, at which point the data is deleted. Writing to transient replicas can be avoided almost entirely if monotonic reads are not required because it is possible to achieve a quorum of acknowledged writes without them.

===  Finding Bugs in Cassandra's Internals with Property-based Testing
[discrete]
==== October 17, 2018
------
[openblock,card-content]
------
As of September 1st, the Apache Cassandra community has shifted the focus of Cassandra 4.0 development from new feature work to testing, validation, and hardening, with the goal of releasing a stable 4.0 that every Cassandra user, from small deployments to large corporations, can deploy with confidence. There are several projects and methodologies that the community is undertaking to this end. One of these is the adoption of property-based testing, which was previously introduced here. This post will take a look at a specific use of this approach and how it found a bug in a new feature meant to ensure data integrity between the client and Cassandra.

[discrete]
==== August 21, 2018
------
[openblock,card-content]

With the goal of ensuring reliability and stability in Apache Cassandra 4.0, the project’s committers have voted to freeze new features on September 1 to concentrate on testing and validation before cutting a stable beta. Towards that goal, the community is investing in methodologies that can be performed at scale to exercise edge cases in the largest Cassandra clusters. The result, we hope, is to make Apache Cassandra 4.0 the best-tested and most reliable major release right out of the gate.

===  Hardware-bound Zero Copy Streaming in Apache Cassandra 4.0
[discrete]
==== August 07, 2018
------
[openblock,card-content]
------
Streaming in Apache Cassandra powers host replacement, range movements, and cluster expansions. Streaming plays a crucial role in the cluster and as such its performance is key to not only the speed of the operations its used in but the cluster’s health generally. In Apache Cassandra 4.0, we have introduced an improved streaming implementation that reduces GC pressure and increases throughput several folds and are now limited, in some cases, only by the disk / network IO (See: CASSANDRA-14556).
