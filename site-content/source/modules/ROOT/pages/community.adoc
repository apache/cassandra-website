== Project Governance

Like all Apache projects, Cassandra is independently managed by its Project Management Committee (PMC). The Cassandra PMC is tasked with project management—especially technical direction, votes on new committers and PMC members for the project, and sets policies as well as formally voting on software product releases. Our guiding philosophies are to default to the dev list and “decide as a community,” and to favor PMC minimalism.

=== Becoming a contributor
----------

[openblock, float75 full-800]
----------
Contributors are individuals who contribute patches—source code, documentation, help on mailing lists, website—to Apache projects. While contributors do not have a specific governance role, they are crucial to the project’s success. Read the docs to learn how to link:{site-url}_/development/index.html[contribute to Cassandra,window=blank], and review our https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/Apache+Cassandra+Project+Governance[governance,window=blank] page to understand how we vote on code contributions.

[openblock, float75 full-800]
----------

Committers are members of a project development community who have been granted write access to an Apache project. New committers and PMC members are elected by the Cassandra PMC based on merit. https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/#technical[More on committers,window=blank].

=== Reporting Bugs

----------

[openblock, float75 full-800]
----------
If you encounter a problem with Cassandra, the first places to ask for help are the xref:community.adoc#discussions[user mailing list,window=blank] and the #cassandra https://s.apache.org/slack-invite[Slack channel,window=blank].

If, after having asked for help, you suspect that you have found a bug in Cassandra, you should report it by opening a ticket through the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA[Apache Cassandra JIRA tracking system,window=blank]. Please provide as much detail as you can on your problem. Don’t forget to indicate which version of Cassandra you are running and on which environment.

The Cassandra Enhancement Proposal (CEP) provides a process for the proposal, discussion and endorsement of new feature development in Cassandra. Anyone can initiate a CEP, but it should only be done if you have the intention and capability to complete the proposed change. Learn how to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=95652201[propose and shepherd a CEP,window=blank].
