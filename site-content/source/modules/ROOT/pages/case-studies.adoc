This is probably going to be the most engineering non-answer ever, which is simply that I haven’t really had to care about Cassandra since we made the changes and upgrades. Usually if I was getting paged in the middle of the night, it probably had something to do with a brief Cassandra blip that was causing an increased response time. That has just gone away completely.
