==== Day One: Next Generation Cassandra Conference (NGCC)

NGCC (Next Generation Cassandra Conference), a one-day event for Apache
Cassandra contributors and large system operators to meet, discuss, and
plan future development in the project. NGCC will take place on
*Tuesday, September 10th*.

NGCC is an advanced event targeted toward Apache Cassandra contributors
and large system / platform operators. Content will focus on Cassandra
internals and is geared toward those with detailed knowledge of the
codebase and architecture. All are welcome to attend.

 

==== Day Two: Apache Cassandra Summit

The Apache Cassandra Summit, a one-day event for Apache Cassandra users
to meet, network, and learn about what’s new and what’s coming in
Cassandra. The Apache Cassandra Summit will be held on *Wednesday, Sept
11*.

The Apache Cassandra Summit is targeted toward a wider audience. Topics
should be interesting and accessible to those whose first introduction
to Cassandra is at this event, and those who have been active in the
community for many years.
