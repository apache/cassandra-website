=== Cassandra 5.0 is coming soon!

We are excited about the upcoming availability of Apache Cassandra 5.0, the project’s major release for 2023! With a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence, this release brings a host of exciting features and enhancements that empower you to take your data-driven applications to the next level.

*Here’s an overview of some of the release’s major features:*

=== https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16052[Storage Attached Indexes^]

Our new Storage Attached Indexes provide lightning-fast data retrieval, allowing you to access the information you need with unprecedented speed and efficiency. __https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBuIQSLxtnk&list=PLqcm6qE9lgKKls90MlpejceYUU_0qVnWa&index=12&t=1s[Watch this video about Storage Attached Indexes^]__.

=== https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/kYuqCw[Trie Memtables^] and https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/1Y0ODg[Trie SSTables^]

Cassandra 5.0 includes Trie-based Memtables and SSTables, optimizing memory and storage usage, and ultimately improving the performance of your database. __https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKxj6s4vzmI&list=PLqcm6qE9lgKKls90MlpejceYUU_0qVnWa&index=13[Watch this video about Trie Memtables^]__.

=== xref:blog/Apache-Cassandra-5.0-Features-Mathematical-CQL-Functions.adoc[New Mathematical CQL Functions^]

Take advantage of new mathematical CQL functions, including abs, exp, log, log10, and round, to perform complex calculations within your queries.

=== https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/UZMODg[Unified Compaction Strategy^]

Streamline data organization and management, enhancing the efficiency and performance of your clusters.

=== https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/OQ40Dw[Vector Search^]

Cassandra 5.0 introduces vector search, which leverages storage-attached indexing and dense indexing techniques to transform data exploration and analysis. This update is especially impactful for domains like machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). __https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxc-JLRx450&list=PLqcm6qE9lgKKls90MlpejceYUU_0qVnWa&index=10[Watch this video about Vector Search^]__.

=== https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/jotrDQ[Dynamic Data Masking^]

Cassandra 5.0 introduces new dynamic data masking (DDM) capabilities which allow you to obscure sensitive information using a concept called masked columns. DDM doesn't change the stored data. Instead, it just presents the data in its redacted form during SELECT queries.

=== And Much More...
