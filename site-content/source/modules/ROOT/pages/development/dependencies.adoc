== Dependency Management

New dependencies should not be included without community consensus first being
obtained via a `[DISCUSS]` thread on the dev@cassandra.apache.org mailing list.

As Cassandra is an ASF project, all included libraries must follow
Apache's https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html[software license
requirements].

Cassandra uses the Ant build system and Maven POMs for dependency specification.
In Cassandra 4.2 the format of POMs was moved from within the `build.xml` file to separate POM template files that are processed by Ant.
In both pre-4.2 and post-4.2 Cassandra, there are several POMs that dependencies can be included in:

* *parent-pom*
    - Contains all dependencies with the respective version. All other poms
      will refer to the artifacts with specified versions listed here.
    - Since Cassandra 4.2, the `parent-pom` template is `.build/parent-pom-template.xml`.
* *build-deps-pom(-sources)* + *coverage-deps-pom*
    - used by the `ant build` target. Listed dependencies will be resolved and
      copied to `build/lib/{jar,sources}` by executing the
      `maven-ant-tasks-retrieve-build` target. This should contain libraries that are
      required for build tools (grammar, docs, instrumentation), but are not
      shipped as part of the Cassandra distribution.
    - Since Cassandra 4.0, `coverage-deps-pom` has been removed and the
      `build-deps-pom` template is `.build/cassandra-build-deps-template.xml`.
* *all-pom*
    - POM for https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.cassandra/cassandra-all[cassandra-all.jar]
      that can be installed or deployed to public maven repos via `ant publish`.
    - Since Cassandra 4.2, the `all-pom` template is `.build/cassandra-deps-template.xml`.
* *test-deps-pom*
    - Referenced by `maven-ant-tasks-retrieve-test` to retrieve and save
      dependencies to `build/test/lib`. Exclusively used during JUnit test
      execution.
    - Since Cassandra 3.0, `test-deps-pom` has been removed.

The `ant write-poms` target produces valid POM files in the `build/` directory.

=== Dependency management before Cassandra 4.2

To update dependencies, update the parent and child POM definitions in
`build.xml`. The parent POM should include the `dependency` tag with `groupId`,
`artifactId`, `version`, and optional `scope` fields. The child POM(s) should
include the `dependency` tag with `groupId` and `artifactId`. See the
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Management[Maven docs]
for a complete reference on how to reference dependencies across parent and
child POMs.

Here is
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/4b3f07fc74089151efeff7a8fdfa9c414a1f0d6a#diff-766797f233c18114f9499750cf1ffbf3829aeea50283850619c01bd173132021[an example]
of a commit that changes dependency versions pre-4.2.

=== Dependency management in Cassandra 4.2 and later

In Cassandra 4.2 and later, dependencies are managed in Maven POM templates in
`.build/\*-template.xml`. These templates are processed into valid Maven POMs
and copied to `build/\*.pom` by the `ant write-poms` task.

For new dependencies, add to `parent-pom-template` and
`cassandra-deps-template`, and optionally `cassandra-build-deps-template` if
the dependency is required for build only.  See
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Management[the Maven docs]
on how to reference dependencies in the parent POM from the child POMs.

For dependency versions that need to be available in `build.xml` and
`parent-pom-template`, specify the version as a property in `build.xml`, add it
to the `ant write-poms` target, then add the property to `parent-pom-template`
with the value of the template substitution.

Here is
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/b61bd93e574503aff8c29f0efefbe9879d3b32eb[an example]
of a commit that changes dependency versions since 4.2.

=== Troubleshooting and conflict resolution

Here are some useful commands that may help you out resolving conflicts.

* `ant realclean` - gets rid of the build directory, including build
artifacts.
* `mvn dependency:tree -f build/apache-cassandra-\*-SNAPSHOT.pom -Dverbose -Dincludes=org.slf4j`
- shows transitive dependency tree for artifacts, e.g. org.slf4j. In
case the command above fails due to a missing parent pom file, try
running `ant mvn-install`.
* `rm ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/cassandra/apache-cassandra/` - removes
cached local Cassandra maven artifacts
