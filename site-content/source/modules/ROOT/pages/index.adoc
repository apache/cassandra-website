== What is Apache Cassandra?
[discrete]
=== Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
[openblock,features-wrapper cf]

[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------

[discrete]
=== Hybrid
Masterless architecture and low latency means Cassandra will withstand an entire data center outage with no data loss—across public or private clouds and on-premises.
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------
image:Icons/fault.png[]
[discrete]
=== Fault Tolerant
Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime.
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------
image:Icons/scalable.png[]
[discrete]
=== Focus on Quality
To ensure reliability and stability, Cassandra is tested on clusters as large as 1,000 nodes and with hundreds of real world use cases and schemas tested with replay, fuzz, property-based, fault-injection, and performance tests. 
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------

[discrete]
=== Performant
Cassandra http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdf[consistently outperforms,window=_blank] popular NoSQL alternatives in benchmarks and real applications, primarily because of fundamental architectural choices.
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------

[discrete]
=== You're In Control
Choose between synchronous or asynchronous replication for each update. Highly available asynchronous operations are optimized with features like Hinted Handoff and Read Repair.
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------
image:Icons/cloud_native.png[]
[discrete]
=== Security and Observability
The audit logging feature for operators tracks the DML, DDL, and DCL activity with minimal impact to normal workload performance, while the fqltool allows the capture and replay of production workloads for analysis. 
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------
image:Icons/decentral.png[]
[discrete]
=== Distributed
Cassandra is suitable for applications that can't afford to lose data, even when an entire data center goes down. There are no single points of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical.
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------
image:Icons/scalable.png[]
[discrete]
=== Scalable
Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.
----------
[openblock,feature text-center ma-small my-large pa-small]
----------
image:Icons/elastic.png[]
[discrete]
=== Elastic
Cassandra streams data between nodes during scaling operations such as adding a new node or datacenter during peak traffic times. Zero Copy Streaming makes this up to 5x faster without vnodes for a more elastic architecture particularly in cloud and Kubernetes environments.

== Cassandra Users
Cassandra is used by thousands of companies with large active data sets.

"Since 2016, application engineers at Bloomberg have turned to Cassandra because it’s easy to use, easy to scale, and always available. We serve up more than 20 billion requests per day on a nearly 1 PB dataset across a fleet of 1,700+ Cassandra nodes." 

*– Isaac Reath, Software Engineering Team Lead, NoSQL Infrastructure at Bloomberg*

"We needed something that would handle really high write throughput and keep scaling on the write throughput. That forced us to look at distributed stores, and Apache Cassandra was the option that fitted what we needed."

=== Apache Cassandra 4.0 Overview

Apache Cassandra 4.0 is the most stable release in the project's history and is the beginning of a shift to a 12-month release cycle with release supported for a three-year term. The latest version has undergone intensive testing a sets a new high benchmark for distributed databases, and includes new features that offer:

* Increased speed and scalability
* Improved consistency
* New configuration settings
* Minimized latency
* Enhanced security and observability
* Better compression

=== Apache Cassandra Changelog #9 
Jon Meredith joins the PMC, and Apache Cassandra 4.0 garners lots of positive press coverage. Meanwhile, users of Apache Cassandra 3.0.23, 3.0.24, 3.11.9, and 3.11.10 are advised to upgrade due to a potential for data corruption during schema changes. Changelog #9 also includes an update from the Kubernetes SIG on cass-operator and K8ssandra's support for Cassandra 4.0. At the same time, developers are reminded that Cassandra Enhancement Proposals are required for features that change the codebase.

=== Cassandra on Kubernetes: A Beginner's Guide
Take a high-level look at the challenges of Kubernetes and the data layer—learn how the community built cass-operator to reduce the complexities. The operator supplies a translation layer between what Kubernetes needs to maintain and the actual implementation by the database. The guide also covers deploying Cassandra on Kubernetes with a single Helm chart and open-source K8ssandra, a distribution of Apache Cassandra that runs on Kubernetes, which offers a suite of tools to ease and automate operational tasks.
