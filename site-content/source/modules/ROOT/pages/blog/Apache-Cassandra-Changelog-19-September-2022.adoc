== Release Notes

=== Released

The release of Apache Cassandra 4.1 continues to draw closer, and the focus is on the small number of tickets and test failures that block the beta release and release candidate (rc) for 4.1. The consensus on the release approach is "when a green run, go beta, when three green and no other tickets open, go GA."

In the interim, we continue to release new versions of Cassandra, and the latest is https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/4.0.6/apache-cassandra-4.0.6-bin.tar.gz[4.0.6^] (https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.6/apache-cassandra-4.0.6-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.6/apache-cassandra-4.0.6-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.6/apache-cassandra-4.0.6-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]), which went live on 28 August. This release fixes https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17765[an issue^] that broke installations on CentOS Linux 7.

This version is https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=CHANGES.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-4.0.6[a bug fix release on the 4.0 series^], and, as always, please
pay attention to the https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-4.0.6[Release Notes^] and let us know if you encounter any problems.

The other supported releases remain Apache Cassandra 3.11 (https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz[3.11.13^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]) and 3.0 series (https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz[3.0.27^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]) and both are bug fixes.

Please read the release notes for https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-3.11.13[3.11.13^] and https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-3.0.27[3.0.27^] and let us know if you encounter any problems.

=== Important: Debian and Red Hat package repositories have now moved. 
For Debian, please, use https://debian.cassandra.apache.org[https://debian.cassandra.apache.org^] and for Red Hat it is https://redhat.cassandra.apache.org/40x/[https://redhat.cassandra.apache.org/40x/^].

*Note:* For this release cycle only, we will continue to support 3.0 as well as the 3.11, 4.0, and 4.1 latest patch versions. See the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/tQzjBw[Release Lifecycle wiki page^] for more details.

See the xref:download.adoc[download section^] for the latest stable and older supported versions of source and binary distributions. Please make sure you read the additional information on the Download page.

To stay up-to-date, we recommend joining the xref:community.adoc#discussions[Cassandra mailing lists].

== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._ 

_For newcomers to the project, we have a useful xref:development/index.adoc[‘Contributing to Cassandra’] page for how to get involved and get started. We would also recommend reading the xref:doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.adoc[overview of the C* architecture^]._

_We use Jira to record project issues. Here’s a handy Jira tip from *Josh McKenzie*: if you want to search for tickets in your area of interest, use this https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20cassandra%20AND%20resolution%20!%3D%20unresolved%20AND%20assignee%20is%20EMPTY%20AND%20summary%20~%20%27ReplaceTextHere%27%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20ASC[URL link^]. Simply swap out ‘ReplaceTextHere’ in the URL query string for what you want to find._

_If you’d like to help us get 4.1 over the line, check out the unassigned tickets marked as https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2454&quickFilter=2160[beta and rc blockers^]._ 

_We also recommend viewing two Jira ticket queries we’ve created. One is a curated list of https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2454&quickFilter=2160&quickFilter=2162[‘Low Hanging Fruit’ tickets that are unassigned^] and the other is our https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2162&quickFilter=2160[‘Starter Tickets’^] for 4.0.x and 4.1.x. Feel free to self-select a ticket to work on. If you want to find a more challenging ticket just remove the ‘Start Tickets’ filter and dive in!_ 

_Any of the tickets on the curated lists should be of appropriate complexity for someone new to the project to tackle. Just remember to assign yourself to the ticket and acknowledge the status, such as ‘Work in Progress’ and ‘Needs Comitter/Patch Available’ when you submit your patch. You can also reach out on the https://the-asf.slack.com/[ASF Slack^] in the #cassandra-dev Slack channel. We have 13 mentors ready to help, and you can contact them by using @cassandra_mentors._

_You can also read PMC member *Josh McKenzie’s* https://lists.apache.org/thread/vpm42lrmwgqnpc1y854b7b305o280vr4[latest bi-weekly update^] for ongoing discussions and the latest on ticket progress._

=== Announced

This is worth mentioning again—both the Debian and Red Hat repositories have moved. The Debian `sources.list` and Red Hat `cassandra.repo` files must be updated to point to the new repository URLs. You can find more information on the xref:download.adoc[Download page^].

=== Announced

*Aaron Ploetz*, host of the Apache Cassandra Corner podcast has been busy. In https://open.spotify.com/episode/1cjiEragPsIIK44q4tnbJ5[Episode 7^] he spoke to *Ekaterina Dimitrova*, Apache Cassandra Committer, about maintaining the project's stability for Cassandra 4.0, considerations for supporting the Java 17 JDK, and tips on how to get started with contributing to the project. Just as we write this blog, https://open.spotify.com/episode/1dwYTi10sm4D67u0fGoGfF[episode 8 of the Apache Cassandra Corner podcast^] has also landed. For the latest episode Aaron chatted to Sarma Pydipally, a Udemy instructor and open source developer. They discuss his Prometheus-Grafana-Cassandra metrics collector and personal DB journey moving from Oracle to Cassandra. Please listen and share the podcast with your friends.

=== Announced

We are pleased to announce that the Apache Cassandra project was selected for AnitaB.org’s Grace Hopper Celebration, https://ghc.anitab.org/[Open Source Day^], which took place on *16 September 2022*. The event is part of the biggest female-led movement in open source and promotes diversity in the field. The Open Source Day itself was a virtual all-day hackathon where attendees were encouraged to contribute to a curated list of open source projects with the help of experienced mentors. The hackathon was followed up by the main in-person and virtual Grace Hopper Celebration that ran from 20-23 September in Orlando, Florida.


.Apache Cassandra was selected as an Open Source Project for the Open Source Day section of the Grace Hopper Celebration organized by AnitaB.org.

=== Announced

The last in-person event was a Cassandra Day in Berlin on *Tuesday 20 September, 2022*. You can read more about this on the xref:blog/Cassandra-Day-in-Berlin-Announced.adoc[Cassandra blog^]. Mick Semb Wever took this face-to-face opportunity to talk about future plans with community members that are able to attend. This event kickstarts a series of Cassandra city-based events with Amsterdam and London coming up soon. Please read the blog for announcements.

=== Discussed

*Claude Warren* has started a conversation about templates for pull requests. Could they help to make pull requests better? You can catch up with the discussion https://lists.apache.org/thread/bwogjbpmwxd7qongq86lcv03ljqq83ps[here^]

=== Discussed

*Ekaterina Dimitrova* has resumed work on JDK17 support and she is looking for anyone that wants to collaborate on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16895[CASSANDRA-16895^]. As JDK8 is aging, a new JDK is a critical step in deprecated older platforms.

=== Discussed

*Andres de la Pena* has opened up a discussion around a dynamic data masking feature in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/jotrDQ[CEP-20^]. You can follow the discussion https://lists.apache.org/thread/qsmxsymozymy6dy9tp5xw9gn5fhz9nt4[here^]. This feature is valuable to end users and a reflection of the growing maturity of the project and how it is being used by more organizations with compliance requirements.
	
== User Space

=== DoorDash

Ujjwal Gulecha, software engineer at DoorDash, discusses the scaling challenges with their content discovery and achieving reliability in 2022. DoorDash needed to showcase relevant content as banners and carousels on high-traffic surfaces, such as the home page:

[quote,'https://doordash.engineering/2022/06/28/taming-content-discovery-scaling-challenges-with-hexagons-and-elasticsearch/[Ujjwal Gulecha^]']

_"We were able to massively reduce our operational costs while still maintaining high reliability and quality. In particular we were able to reduce ~50% costs for our Cassandra and Redis clusters and around 75% costs on our Kubernetes application hosting costs."_
