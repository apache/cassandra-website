== Release Notes

=== Released

The latest release of Apache Cassandra is https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/4.0.5/apache-cassandra-4.0.5-bin.tar.gz[4.0.5^] (https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.5/apache-cassandra-4.0.5-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.5/apache-cassandra-4.0.5-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.5/apache-cassandra-4.0.5-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]), which we announced on 18 August 2022. Crucially, this release contains https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15511[CASSANDRA-15511^], which will significantly reduce allocations and improve the write throughput, particularly on collections and contended partitions.

While this is the Changelog highlight activities for July, we want to acknowledge the CentOS 7 issue, which will be resolved in Apache Cassandra 4.0.6. This will soon be out and will re-add support for CentOS 7.

Please read the https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-4.0.5[4.0.5 release notes^] and let us know if you encounter any problems.

Our focus remains on the tickets that block the beta release and release candidate for Apache Cassandra 4.1. We have only a handful of unassigned tickets left and these would be a great introduction for someone new to contributing to the project (see details, below, on how to help).

The other supported releases remain Apache Cassandra 3.11 (https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz[3.11.13^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]) and 3.0 series (https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz[3.0.27^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]) and both are bug fixes.

Please read the release notes for https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-3.11.13[3.11.13^] and https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-3.0.27[3.0.27^] and let us know if you encounter any problems.

*Note:* For this release cycle only, we will continue to support 3.0. as well as the 3.11., 4.0., and 4.1 latest patch versions. See xref:blog/Behind-the-scenes-of-an-Apache-Cassandra-Release.adoc[Behind the Scenes of an Apache Cassandra Release] for more details.

See the xref:download.adoc[download section] for the latest stable and older supported versions of source and binary distributions. Please make sure you read the additional information on the Download page as the *Debian and RedHat package repositories have moved*.

To stay up-to-date, we recommend joining the  xref:community.adoc#discussions[Cassandra mailing lists].

== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._ 

_For newcomers to the project, we have a useful xref:development/index.adoc[‚ÄòContributing to Cassandra‚Äô] page for how to get involved and get started. We would also recommend reading the link:/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html[overview of the C* architecture]._

_If you‚Äôd like to help us get 4.1 over the line, check out the unassigned tickets marked as https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2454&quickFilter=2160[beta blockers^]. These are great candidates for someone new to the project._ 

_We also recommend viewing two Jira ticket queries we‚Äôve created. One is a Kanban board for https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=496&quickFilter=2252[‚ÄúFailing Tests‚Äù tickets that are unassigned^] and the other corresponds to our https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2162&quickFilter=2160[Low Hanging Fruit or ‚ÄúStarter Tickets‚Äù^] for 4.0.x and 4.1.x. Feel free to self-select a ticket to work on._ 

_Any of these tickets should be of appropriate complexity for someone new to the project to tackle. Just remember to assign yourself to the ticket and acknowledge the status, such as ‚ÄòWork in Progress‚Äô and ‚ÄòNeeds Comitter/Patch Available‚Äô when you submit your patch. You can also reach out on the https://the-asf.slack.com/[ASF Slack^] in the #cassandra-dev Slack channel. We have 13 mentors ready to help, and you can contact them by using @cassandra_mentors._

_You can also read PMC member *Josh McKenzie‚Äôs* https://lists.apache.org/thread/3chthoxo4bjcx9b1bbzv4ptf766ns513[latest bi-weekly update^] for ongoing discussions and the latest on ticket progress._

=== Announced

The Project Management Committee (PMC) is pleased to announce that *Jacek Lewandowski* has been invited to become a committer, and he has accepted! Thanks for all your contributions, Jacek! üëè

=== Announced

The community would also like to offer our appreciation to *Nate McCall*, who https://lists.apache.org/thread/5l9xskv5k6q2fshw7oltwh6fz196pwk6[stepped down^] from the PMC chair role in July. Thanks for all your many years of hard work, Nate!üëè

The position of chair is an administrative position that interfaces with the Apache Software Foundation Board, by submitting regular reports about project status and health. Read more about the PMC chair role on Apache projects. For anyone unaware of how ASF projects are run, you can learn more about PMCs and the various roles by reading the https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc[ASF guide^]. 

And the cycle continues with the announcement of Mick Semb Wever as the new PMC chair and we wish him the best of luck in the role! üëç

=== Announced

The https://open.spotify.com/episode/1UwAaaKV2rzvkGNJO8PIiP[next episode of The Apache Cassandra Corner^] podcast is available now. Host, *Aaron Ploetz*, discovers what‚Äôs really happening when you turn on your smart TV by chatting to Jeff Beck, Director at SmartThings. The conversation covers Apache Cassandra‚Äôs role in powering your entertainment and Jeff‚Äôs experience of supporting Cassandra at a global scale.

=== Discussed

As part of the implementation work for https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/FQRACw[CEP-15 General-Purpose Transactions^], *Blake Eggleston* has been https://lists.apache.org/thread/5sds3968mnnk42c24pvgwphg4qvo2xk0[drafting syntax for Accord^], the new leaderless timestamp protocol. There was much discussion about the right approach, which has now converged, defining the syntax we will use for multi-key transactions and bringing CEP-15 ever closer.

Also affecting CEP-15, *Avi Kivity* opened up https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17762[a ticket^] about the challenges of our eclectic usage of NULL strikes, while *Caleb Rackliffe* continues to work on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17719[CQL support for multi-partition transactions^] where, Josh McKenzie has indicated, the general sentiment is to go with ‚Äúa SQL-congruent syntax."

=== Discussed

*Amit Pawar* started a thread that‚Äôs generated a discussion on the potential benefits and shortcomings of https://lists.apache.org/thread/5j8ljtpdw3g0gyrx6m31gh1gjdkztclg[a multi-threaded flushing CommitLog^]. Benchmarking complex features like this have proven difficult, and anyone with the knowledge of the subject is very welcome to contribute.

=== Discussed

*Andr√©s de la Pe√±a* has raised a question about inclusivity or exclusivity of token ranges, and API consistency came up because https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17575[CASSANDRA-17575^]. You can follow and join in the discussion https://lists.apache.org/thread/4tm626ffnqlvt4cbmopdfpd8w6fpqscd[here^].

=== Discussed

*Ekaterina Dimitrova* continues to raise and resolve many of the questions about our properties, their units, and configuration parameters. This time the https://lists.apache.org/thread/vgnjnkhbml7zocxpohth8x443rzgvbz5[issue^] was the conversion of megabits and mebibytes producing double numbers, and how it should be handled in JMX/nodetool when reporting it to the users.

*Henrik Ingo* opened an email thread on the potential of developing a separate Apache Cassandra‚Äôs ecosystem site or revamping the existing Ecosystem section to potentially enable developers to maintain their own tool entries. You can join the conversation and get involved in collaborating https://lists.apache.org/thread/0839pvq8ob18782fpjy2coro17v7lyvg[here^].
	
== User Space

=== Spotify

Speaking on the development of Backstage, the open platform for building developer portals, and work on Backstage Kubernetes in 2021:

[quote,'https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/lwb31v/were_the_engineers_rethinking_kubernetes_at/[Spotify^]']

‚ÄúSpotify is mostly on GCP so our developers use a mix of Google managed storage products and self-managed ones. The managed storage solutions Spotify developers use are Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, CloudSQL, and Cloud Firestore. The unmanaged storage solutions Spotify devs start and operate themselves on GCE include Apache Cassandra, PostgreSQL, Memcached, Elastic Search, and Redis.‚Äù
