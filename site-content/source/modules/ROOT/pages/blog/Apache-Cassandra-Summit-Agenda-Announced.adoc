== Schedule announced

We are less than two months away from *Cassandra Summit*, the https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cassandra-summit/attend/about/[biggest festival celebrating the world of Apache Cassandra^]. Today, we are thrilled to finally share https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-linux-foundation-announces-conference-schedule-for-cassandra-summit-2023-301724478.html[The Linux Foundation's announcement of the full schedule^] for this not to be missed two-day celebration.

On *March 13-14*, 2023, the community and the thriving ecosystem around the popular massively scalable open source NoSQL distributed database, will gather in San Jose, California to share and plan the future of Cassandra.

*Cassandra Summit* is an opportunity to connect with thousands of database practitioners, developers, engineers and influencers, and to take a deep dive into Apache Cassandra, discover how it powers global enterprises every day (and night). The event will feature a robust program of 60 sessions, covering a wide range of topics including developing applications with Cassandra, cloud-native deployments and strategies, what's coming for future Cassandra versions, and much more.

Throughout the event, attendees will learn how Cassandra is built for this era of computing -- there is nothing else like it! There will be first looks into *Cassandra 5.0* coming this year with ACID transactions, SAI, Accord, all API enhancements, UCS/UFI compaction strategy, SSTables, memtables, dynamic data masking and so much more.

Fresh community faces and up-and-coming end-users from around the world will share how they're using Cassandra in new and dynamic computing scenarios. There will, of course, be familiar faces too as community leaders and contributors will share how they're coming together to shape the future of Cassandra.

The 2023 conference session highlights include:
