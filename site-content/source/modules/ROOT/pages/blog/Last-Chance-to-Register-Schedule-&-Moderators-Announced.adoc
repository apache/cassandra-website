The https://www.cassandraworldparty.org/[Apache Cassandra World Party (CWP)^] is this *Wednesday, July 20, 2022*! CWP is a one-day virtual event, held in three time zones, that unites the global community to celebrate the people and the technology behind Apache Cassandra.

=== Moderators Confirmed

The event promises to be a lot of fun with fast and informative talks from the Cassandra community, where speakers are given five minutes and their slides auto-advance every minute whether they’re ready or not. Today, we’re pleased to announce that the moderators for each session will be:

*1200-1300 UTC:* Jeremy Hanna and Chris Bradford

*1800-1900 UTC:* Ekaterina Dimitrova and Patrick McFadin

*0100-0200 UTC* Ben Bromhead and Erick Ramirez

To see the full schedule for these sessions, visit https://www.cassandraworldparty.org/. 

=== Local Watch Party Update

Unfortunately, we have some sad news to relay. As COVID-19 infection levels have reached a record high in the UK, we have taken the difficult decision to postpone the London Watch Party for the safety of attendees, but UK community members can still gather together online for the virtual event, which will take place between *1800-1900 UTC*. 

If you https://5iwm1iun629.typeform.com/to/R9eTh906?typeform-source=www.cassandraworldparty.org[register^] for CWP updates, we will provide details of the future Cassandra event as soon as they have been confirmed.

We would like to thank our official sponsors for this year’s Apache Cassandra World Party: https://axonops.com[*AxonOps*^] and https://datastax.com/[*DataStax*^].
