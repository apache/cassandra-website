After the release of Apache Cassandra 4.0 last year, the feature floodgates opened, which means we have a lot to celebrate as the launch of v4.1 draws closer. In particular, this release enhances the pluggable nature of Apache Cassandra, enabling greater flexibility and extensibility without compromising the databaseâ€™s stable core.

Reflecting that flexibility, the second annual https://www.cassandraworldparty.org/[Apache Cassandra World Party^] will be a hybrid event this year.

=== Virtual event details

We have a virtual event with three sessions on *Wednesday, July 20* at 1200-1300 UTC, 1800-1900 UTC, and 0100-0200 UTC.

=== Watch Parties

In addition, there will be in-person gatherings this year. Local Watch Parties will take place where the community can gather to eat, drink, socialize and watch the sessions together. Current locations include *London* (Watch Party hosted by https://axonops.com[AxonOps^]) and *Atlanta* (Watch Party hosted by https://careers.homedepot.com/career-areas/technology/[Home Depot^]) with other locations to be determined.
