The Apache Cassandra community is pleased to announce two in-person Cassandra Day events in Europe in October. The first will take place in *London on 11 October* and the second event is in *Amsterdam on 13 October*. Together with the Berlin event that took place this month we have a veritable ‘Cassandra Day 2022 European tour’.

We would like to thank DataStax for organizing these events which are open to the entire community.

Cassandra Days focus on the open source Apache Cassandra project and the community that supports the project. Everyone (whether they are an individual user, contributor, or company) is welcome to attend and help organize these events.

These events are an opportunity for Apache Cassandra users, enthusiasts, and community members to share their experiences working with Cassandra daily, hear talks and participate in workshops for NoSQL beginners & experts.

=== Event Information

Cassandra Day London & Cassandra Day Amsterdam will take place in-person and will span a whole day, with *hands-on workshops* (Fundamentals; Data Modeling & App Development) in the morning and *a keynote & tech talks* in the afternoon.
