== Release Notes
=== Released

The latest release of Apache Cassandra is https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/4.0.1[4.0.1,window=_blank] (https://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/4.0.1/apache-cassandra-4.0.1-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp,window=_blank], https://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/4.0.1/apache-cassandra-4.0.1-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256,window=_blank], and https://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/4.0.1/apache-cassandra-4.0.1-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512,window=_blank]). This is a rapid release to fix a https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16877[critical bug,window=_blank] in Gossip on large clusters. Please read the https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=CHANGES.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-4.0.1[release notes,window=_blank] and let us know if you encounter any problems.

Note: As the docs are not yet updated, the bintray location for Debian users is replaced with the https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/cassandra/[ASF's JFrog Artifactory location,window=_blank].

See the https://cassandra.apache.org/download/[download section] for the latest stable and older supported versions of source and binary distributions.

To stay up-to-date, we recommend joining the Cassandra xref:community.adoc#join-the-conversation[mailing list].

== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._

_Are you new to the project? We have established a https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484[New Release tracking Kanboard,window=_blank] and a https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2162&quickFilter=2160["Starter Tickets",window=_blank] quick label that corresponds to our Low Hanging Fruit status. Any of these tickets should be of appropriate complexity for someone new to the project to tackle._

Read PMC member Josh McKenzie’s https://lists.apache.org/list.html?\dev@cassandra.apache.org:2021-9[bi-weekly update,window=_blank] for ongoing discussions and the latest on ticket progress.

=== Added

The Project Management Committee (PMC) is pleased to announce that *Aleksei Zotov* has been invited to https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r6ff82e48720931055f5eb0bc494434f5be7959ef78345a642a980419%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[become a committer,window=_blank], and he has accepted! Thank you for all your contributions over the years, Aleksei, and congratulations! &#128079; 

=== Discussed

After the release of Apache Cassandra 4.0, we have many proposed features (Cassandra Enhancement Proposals or CEPs) under discussion, such as https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r33b3040ad0cd874b0ac53d290b6f4f2ecba19a0309c861fc2ee3336d%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[CEP-15: General Purpose Transactions,window=_blank] and https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r895f4b4db7e27dfe36fa404152dcd6c8fe43ff3529079e55399cf3c5%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[CEP-17: Storage Attached Index,window=_blank]. The current list of CEPs and the process for proposing one are https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=95652201[here,window=_blank]. If you’re a developer, join the conversation today and help shape the future of Apache Cassandra!

=== Passed

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb5e950f882196764744c31bc3c13dfbf0603cb9f8bc2f6cfb976d285%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[CEP-11,window=_blank] has passed. This proposal aims to enable users to select a memtable implementation suitable for their workload and hardware, including long-lived and persistent memtables. More details are on the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-11%3A+Pluggable+memtable+implementations[wiki,window=_blank].

=== Passed

The vote for CEP-13 has also https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re374669ffc9c1cd6a647b43a67b24eb1b1fe9b2136c76618707acaa1%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[passed,window=_blank]. This is to add a https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-13%3A+Denylisting+partitions[DenyListing partitions,window=_blank] feature, enabling operators to disallow the reading of specific partition keys that could cause undesirable effects on the entire node or within the cluster. You can read more about this in the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-13%3A+Denylisting+partitions[CEP wiki entry,window=_blank].

=== Proposed

We have a formal proposal from Brian Houser for https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ree85077637f14435e9eb14e0db887d2e9d94e956ccbf1e1ac9d53aa2%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[CEP-16: Auth Plugin Support for CQLSH,window=_blank]. This will ensure that CQLSH has the same support for different authentication methods that we have for other Cassandra drivers. For more details, read the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-16%3A+Auth+Plugin+Support+for+CQLSH[CEP wiki entry,window=_blank].

=== Discussed

As always, there are lots of discussions going on. Ekaterina Dimitrova started a good conversation on https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r507be1624a568765f9d5ec5f6b561885129d0aaeb982e9bd9bf5e01b%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[standardizing configuration and JVM parameters,window=_blank] and drove a discussion on https://lists.apache.org/list.html?\dev@cassandra.apache.org:2021-8[JDK 17 support,window=_blank], which is now being developed. We are also defining https://lists.apache.org/list.html?\dev@cassandra.apache.org:2021-9[which code changes target which types of release,window=_blank], deciding when a minor becomes a major, for example, and when feature flags should be used. Josh McKenzie is putting together a wiki on this, and we will run a blog piece on the outcomes from the discussion in the hope it helps other open source projects facing similar questions.

=== Added

The latest release of https://drill.apache.org/download/[Apache Drill 1.19,window=_blank], an open source tool that enables end-users to query multiple data sources using SQL, now includes a https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-92[Cassandra plugin,window=_blank].

=== Changed

The Kubernetes SIG has decided to move away from bi-weekly meetings as the original reasons for running them have been met. The SIG will be moving to a meetup-style gathering where users will share information and exchange ideas. If you want to share something at the next gathering, please contact Patrick McFadin on the https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/C014SSUAL9E[cassandra-kubernetes,window=_blank] Slack channel.

== User Space

=== Capital One

“We have modeled customer rewards data in Capital One using Apache Cassandra to serve real-time microservice-based workloads (customers accessing their rewards online) and batch Apache Spark workloads (customer statements) at the same time.” - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtrRY7XziXU[Gokul Prabagaren,window=_blank]

=== Glassdoor

“At Glassdoor, we use Cassandra to store various datasets needed by search, machine learning models, and other systems. Since most of these systems are built on Java, we use Java drivers for Cassandra, for read, write and delete operations.” - https://medium.com/glassdoor-engineering/cassandra-driver-configuration-for-improved-performance-and-load-balancing-1b0106ce12bb[Ravi Varsha,window=_blank]
