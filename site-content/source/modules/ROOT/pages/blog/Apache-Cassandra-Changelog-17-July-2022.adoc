== Release Notes

=== Released

We are focused on the final blockers to the next release of Apache Cassandra which will be 4.1. At the time of writing, we had 28 tickets remaining and the unassigned tickets would be a great introduction for someone new to contributing to the project (see details, below, on how to help).

The latest release of Apache Cassandra remains https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/4.0.4/apache-cassandra-4.0.4-bin.tar.gz[4.0.4^] (https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.4/apache-cassandra-4.0.4-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.4/apache-cassandra-4.0.4-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], and https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.4/apache-cassandra-4.0.4-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]), which was released on 14 May 2022. 

Please read the https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-4.0.4[4.0.4 release notes^] and let us know if you encounter any problems.

We also had a bug fix releases for both the 3.11 series (https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz[3.11.13^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]) and 3.0 series (https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz[3.0.27^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/3.0.27/apache-cassandra-3.0.27-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^])  that were released on the same day as 4.0.4.

Please read the release notes for https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-3.11.13[3.11.13^] and https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-3.0.27[3.0.27^] and let us know if you encounter any problems.

*Note:* For this release cycle only, we will continue to support 3.0. as well as the 3.11., 4.0., and 4.1 latest patch versions. See xref:blog/Behind-the-scenes-of-an-Apache-Cassandra-Release.adoc[Behind the Scenes of an Apache Cassandra Release] for more details.

See the xref:download.adoc[download section] for the latest stable and older supported versions of source and binary distributions.

To stay up-to-date, we recommend joining the Cassandra  xref:community.adoc#discussions[mailing lists].

== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._ 

_For newcomers to the project, we have a useful xref:development/index.adoc[‚ÄòContributing to Cassandra‚Äô] page for how to get involved and get started._ 

_If you‚Äôd like to help us get 4.1 over the line, check out the unassigned tickets marked as https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2454&quickFilter=2160[beta blockers^]. These are great candidates for someone new to the project._ 

_We also recommend taking a look at two Jira ticket queries we‚Äôve created. One is a Kanban board for https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=496&quickFilter=2252[‚ÄúFailing Tests‚Äù tickets that are unassigned^] and the other corresponds to our https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2162&quickFilter=2160[Low Hanging Fruit or ‚ÄúStarter Tickets‚Äù^] for 4.0.x and 4.1.x. Feel free to self-select a ticket to work on._ 

_Any of these tickets should be of appropriate complexity for someone new to the project to tackle. Just remember to assign yourself to the ticket and acknowledge the status, such as ‚ÄòWork in Progress‚Äô and ‚ÄòNeeds Comitter/Patch Available‚Äô when you submit your patch. You can also reach out on the https://the-asf.slack.com/[ASF Slack^] in the #cassandra-dev Slack channel. Use @cassandra_mentors to contact our mentor team!_

_You can also read PMC member *Josh McKenzie‚Äôs* https://lists.apache.org/thread/g4gjnsn4o5ffs8mzt9tl5yynwkt2vtt7[latest bi-weekly update^] for ongoing discussions and the latest on ticket progress._

=== Announced

The https://www.cassandraworldparty.org/[Apache Cassandra World Party^] is drawing closer and set for *20 July 2022*. At the end of June, we announced some of the xref:blog/Talks-and-Sponsors-Announced-for-Cassandra-World-Party-2022.adoc[speakers], and confirmed a local Watch Party in London. A big thank you to AxonOps for stepping up as an official sponsor this year. üëè

image::blog/the-apache-cassandra-corner-podcast.png[The Apache Cassandra Corner podcast]

=== Announced

*Aaron Ploetz* has launched a community-driven podcast called https://open.spotify.com/show/66VxpDTNUEoU1SgyvvOQKw[Apache Cassandra Corner^].

As you‚Äôd expect, the podcast will cover all things Cassandra, from use cases to projects and the people who make them happen. Aaron has already produced five episodes and the latest show is with *Melissa Logan* on open source marketing and her work with the Data on Kubernetes community. If you‚Äôd like to volunteer to talk about your Cassandra adventures for the podcast, please mailto:aaronploetz@gmail.com[email Aaron, I want to be a guest on Cassandra Corner].

=== Discussed

*Johannes Wei√ül* started a https://lists.apache.org/thread/tt2mmkvp5p0os9k15lwssdbsbqff28s6[thread^] about slow custom unit tests running on Mac OS X. if you have experience of this issue, please contribute to the conversation.

=== Discussed

The role of https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/DI3kCw[Build Lead^] was discussed again in June as it‚Äôs been over six weeks without someone taking up the rotating position. The role is a really helpful way to gain a solid understanding of where the weaknesses are in our CI infrastructure, and to help keep visibility in the project to test failures as we burn them down leading up to 4.1's GA. If you have the bandwidth to help (it only involves a few hours during a week), *Josh McKenzie* is happy to mentor anyone through their first run as build lead. You can contact him on the cassandra-dev channel in https://the-asf.slack.com[ASF Slack^] or email him.

=== Discussed

A popular and ongoing https://lists.apache.org/thread/5sds3968mnnk42c24pvgwphg4qvo2xk0[discussion^], started by *Blake Eggleston* has been on the right way to shape an API around multi-key transactions in Cassandra for https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/FQRACw[General Purpose Transactions:CEP-15^]. If you have an opinion on the shape a transactional / batch API in Cassandra should take, please contribute.

=== Discussed

Comments on a https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16844[JIRA ticket^] generated a discussion on when the project cuts a Major vs. a Minor release and what qualifies as an API. If you want to wade into this discussion, make sure you‚Äôre registered on the Dev mailing list for a future formal discussion coming soon.

== User Space

=== Capital One

[quote,'https://www.cio.com/article/350288/becoming-a-fintech-capital-ones-move-from-mainframes-to-the-cloud.html[David Andrzejek^]']

"One of the bigger advantages of Cassandra is resiliency. Since Cassandra leans towards AP in CAP Theorem, it can manage partition failures to remain available round-the-clock. Cassandra‚Äôs masterless, peer-to-peer architecture ensures that applications never experience downtime even during disastrous system failures.

The company itself has invested a lot of time and effort into our resiliency and this commitment made Cassandra a great choice. It‚Äôs always available. It‚Äôs always there for us. And it has performed rock solid."
