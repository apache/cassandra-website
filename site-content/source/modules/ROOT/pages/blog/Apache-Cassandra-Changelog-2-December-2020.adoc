== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._

=== Added

The community weighed options to address reads inconsistencies for Compact Storage as noted in ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16217[CASSANDRA-16217,window=_blank] (committed). The conversation continues in ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16226[CASSANDRA-16226,window=_blank] with the aim of ensuring there are no huge performance regressions for common queries when you upgrade from 2.x to 3.0 with Compact Storage tables or drop it from a table on 3.0+.

=== Added

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16222[CASSANDRA-16222,window=_blank] is a Spark library that can compact and read raw Cassandra SSTables into SparkSQL. By reading the sstables directly from a snapshot directory, one can achieve high performance with minimal impact to a production cluster. It was used to successfully export a 32TB Cassandra table (46bn CQL rows) to HDFS in Parquet format in around 70 minutes, a 20x improvement on previous solutions.

=== Changed

Great news for https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-2+Kubernetes+Operator[CEP-2: Kubernetes Operator,window=_blank], the community has agreed to https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r9e1ff94d7b35cfc663bfa72d4ed3767e963e890f9e1199bfdb96bff0%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[create a community-based operator,window=_blank] by merging the cass-operator and CassKop. The work being done can be viewed on GitHub https://github.com/datastax/cass-operator[here,window=_blank].

=== Released

The Reaper community https://thelastpickle.com/blog/2020/10/26/reaper-2_1-released-with-astra-support.html[announced v2.1,window=_blank] of its tool that schedules and orchestrates repairs of Apache Cassandra clusters. Read the http://cassandra-reaper.io/docs/[docs,window=_blank].

=== Netflix

“With these optimized Cassandra clusters in place, it now costs us 71% less to operate clusters and we could store 35x more data than our previous configuration.” - https://netflixtechblog.com/building-netflixs-distributed-tracing-infrastructure-bb856c319304[Maulik Pandey,window=_blank]

=== Yelp 

“Cassandra is a distributed wide-column NoSQL datastore and is used at Yelp for both primary and derived data. Yelp’s infrastructure for Cassandra has been deployed on AWS EC2 and ASG (Autoscaling Group) for a while now. Each Cassandra cluster in production spans multiple AWS regions.” - https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2020/11/orchestrating-cassandra-on-kubernetes-with-operators.html[Raghavendra D Prabhu,window=_blank]
