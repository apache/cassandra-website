=== Changed

A vulnerability rated `Important` was found when using the `dc` or `rack` internode_encryption setting. More details of CVE-2020-17516 Apache Cassandra internode encryption enforcement vulnerability are available on this https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r883eccde63637ea18ab5890c09c18e9573f8080bbccaa5ccd1304b8f%40%3Cuser.cassandra.apache.org%3E[user thread,window=_blank].

Note: The mitigation for 3.11.x users requires an update to 3.11.10 not 3.11.24, as originally stated in the CVE. (For anyone who has perfected a flux capacitor, we would like to borrow it.)

The current status of Cassandra 4.0 GA can be viewed on this https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=355&quickFilter=1661[Jira board,window=_blank] (ASF login required). RC is imminent with testing underway. The remaining tickets represent 3.3% of the total scope. Read the latest summary from the community https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbc7e4664c0261b0d82baf4b303a7f10977bf138a7419d97d737e0b1a%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[here,window=_blank].

== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._

=== Added

Apache Cassandra will be participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) under the ASF umbrella as a mentoring organization. This is a great opportunity to get involved, especially for newcomers to the Cassandra community.

We’re curating a list of JIRA tickets this month, which will be labeled as `gsoc2021`. This will make them visible in the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYNAPSE-1125?jql=labels%20%3D%20gsoc2021[Jira issue tracker,window=_blank] for participants to see and connect with mentors.

If you would like to volunteer to be a mentor for a GSoC project, please tag the respective JIRA ticket with the `mentor` label. Non-committers can volunteer to be a mentor as long as there is a committer as co-mentor. Projects can be mentored by one or more co-mentors.

Thanks to Paulo Motta for proposing the idea and getting the ticket list going.

=== Added

Apache Zeppelin http://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html[0.9.0,window=_blank] was released on January 15. Zeppelin is a collaborative data analytics and visualization tool for distributed, general-purpose data processing system, which supports Apache Cassandra and others. The release notes for the Cassandra CQL Interpreter are available http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/interpreter/cassandra.html[here,window=_blank].

=== Changed

For the GA of Apache Cassandra 4.0, any claim of support for Python 2 will be dropped from update documentation. We will also introduce a warning when running in Python 2.7. Support for Python 3 will be backported to at least 3.11, due to existing tickets, but we will undertake the work needed to make packaging and internal tooling support Python 3.

=== Changed

The Kubernetes SIG is discussing how to encourage more participation and to structure SIG meetings around updates on Kubernetes and Cassandra. We also intend to invite other projects (like OpenEDS, Prometheus, and others) to discuss how we can make Cassandra and Kubernetes better. As well as updates, the group discussed handling large-scale backups inside Kubernetes and using S3 APIs to store images. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5mEgFquIoo[Watch here,window=_blank].
