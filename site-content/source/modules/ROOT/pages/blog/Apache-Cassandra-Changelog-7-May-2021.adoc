== User Space

=== Grubhub

When Grubhub and Seamless merged, the company set out to build a new platform. One of those important decisions was deciding to use Apache Cassandra as the primary persistent data store for Grubhub’s backend services: “Our goal was to build a highly scalable, highly available system that could scale to meet traffic, handle various network and infrastructure outages as well as our growing business needs.” - https://bytes.grubhub.com/cloud-infrastructure-at-grubhub-94db998a898a[William Blackie,window=_blank]

=== Home Depot

Home Depot has been on an accelerated digital transformation through the pandemic, moving to an architecture that connects logistics, delivery, supply chain, customers, digital channels, and associates. One key effort involved using Apache Cassandra to stand up curb side apps quickly. “Some of the tenants of that One Home Depot journey has been creating a set of common services, a common API, a common compute environment. There will be shared decisions between all our different channels. As we've developed these common services, we have been able to really reconcile what a customer sees online, what an associate gets to see in store, and how to connect it all together.” - https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-home-depot-navigated-a-demand-boom-during-covid-19/[Fahim Siddiqui,window=_blank]
