:description: The Apache Cassandra Community
:keywords: 

The Cassandra Kubernetes SIG is excited to share that there has been coalescence around the https://github.com/datastax/cass-operator[Cass Operator,window=_blank] project as the community-based operator.

It is no understatement to say that moving towards a single operator for the Apache Cassandra community has been a technical challenge. There are several xref:blog/Cassandra-and-Kubernetes-SIG-Update-and-Survey.adoc[Kubernetes operator projects for Cassandra,window=_blank], and there were at least five different ways to go about this. Initially, it seemed we were going to create a standard and build a fresh operator from scratch, adopting the others’ ideas. For more details on this discussion, check out this lengthy dev mailing list https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r473275258f3203121935c2412fbe94c0fc368fe17b72141957afef62%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[thread,window=_blank].

For the next stage, the SIG is focused on increasing Cass Operator’s community adoption with the ultimate goal of bringing the project into the ASF.

=== Why Cass-Operator?

Several features of the Cass-Operator project, open-sourced by DataStax, made it the prime candidate for the other projects to rally around. (You can read about the five major Kubernetes Operators for Cassandra in the last xref:blog/Cassandra-and-Kubernetes-SIG-Update-and-Survey.adoc[Cassandra SIG update].)

*High Level Architecture of the Cass Operator in Kubernetes*

Cass-Operator has major features for datacenter provisioning and operations and has Apache Cassandra’s best practices baked into the automations:

* *Bootstraps nodes appropriately* - this feature is important because when Cassandra starts up it needs to start the initial seeds first, in each rack, in a uniform manner.
* *Scales up and scales down clusters gracefully* - nodes are intelligently scaled up and down one at a time across racks so that replicas of data are uniformly distributed.
* *Automated node recovery processes* - basic operations such as restart, replace node, or replace an instance are all automated.
* *Basic topology* - this feature makes multi-DC / multi-rack clusters fairly easy to create.
* *Advanced topology* - Advanced networking at the Kubernetes layer makes multi-region / multi-K8s clusters possible with CNIs such as Cilium or externally via traditional networking tools.
* *Customizable containers* - applying containerization best practice, this enables human operators to merge containers they have built with what’s offered in the cass-operator so that they don’t have to deal with secrets/volumes.

=== Cass-Operator Differentiators

Cass-Operator has many general features that distinguish it even before it is merged with the powerful features that CassKop will supply:

* The operator leverages a number of existing open source tools in the OSS ecosystem and commercial components that have been open-sourced to avoid issues with vendor lock-in:
* Open-sourced Cass Config Builder extracted from DataStax OpsCenter Life Cycle Manager.
* Open-sourced Management API for Apache Cassandra (MAAC).
* Open-sourced Metrics Collector for Apache Cassandra (MCAC).
* Open-sourced SRE tools such as Prometheus and Grafana Operator.
* PodTemplateSpec enables operators to super-customize existing pods.
* Cass-Operator implements advanced networking and manages the node ports and host networks.
* Management API mTLS support provides simple security.
* Automated generation of keystore and truststore for internode and client to node TLS.
* Automated superuser account configuration according to best practices.
* NetworkTopologyStrategy is automatically applied with appropriate replication factor (RF) for system keyspaces.
* Webhook validation ensures that invalid changes are rejected with a helpful message.
* Rolling cluster updates which allow for changes related to a change in binary (C* upgrade), a change in configuration, and canary deployments - single rack application of changes for validation before broader deployment.
* Operator certification and thorough testing on several platforms, including Azure AKS, Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Red Hat OpenShift, and VMWare Tanzu Kubernetes.
* Well documented cloud storage classes, ingress solutions and reference Implementations with an example application using the Java driver.
* Super-useful cluster-level stop / resume, which stops all running instances while keeping persistent storage. This feature allows for scaling compute down to zero, and bringing the cluster back up follows the expected Cassandra startup processes.

=== CassKop operator features that are being merged

There are features in the CassKop operator, open-sourced by Orange Telecom, which are being merged/committed into the CassOperator project:

* Node labeling to map any internal architecture, including network-specific labels to help with multi-datacenter setup.
* Volumes and sidecar management (which could be linked to PodTemplateSpec).
* Backup & Restore (Note: the CassKop project ruled out using https://velero.io/[Velero,window=_blank], and used https://github.com/instaclustr/esop[Instaclustr esop,window=_blank] but https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-medusa[Medusa,window=_blank] could work too).
* Kubectl plugin integration, which is useful on the ops side without an admin UI.
* MultiCassKop evolution to drive multiple Cass-Operators clusters instead of multiple CassKops clusters (Note: This may remain Orange internal if too specific)

As you can see, there’s a lot of great things being developed for the Apache Cassandra project so that relates well with the Kubernetes world. We’ll also have a roadmap post soon. Join us for the next Cassandra Kubernetes SIG meeting or say hi on the https://the-asf.slack.com/[Apache Software Foundation’s Slack team,window=_blank] by joining the https://app.slack.com/client/T4S1WH2J3/C014SSUAL9E[#cassandra-kubernetes,window=_blank] channel.
