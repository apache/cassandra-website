== Release Notes

=== Released

The latest release of Apache Cassandra is https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/4.0.3/apache-cassandra-4.0.3-bin.tar.gz[4.0.3^] (https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.3/apache-cassandra-4.0.3-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.3/apache-cassandra-4.0.3-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], and https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.3/apache-cassandra-4.0.3-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]), which has been available since 17 February 2022. As stated in the xref:blog/Apache-Cassandra-Changelog-13-March-2022.adoc[last changelog blog], we released new versions of all supported versions of Cassandra (https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.11.12/apache-cassandra-3.11.12-bin.tar.gz[3.11.12^], https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/3.0.26/apache-cassandra-3.0.26-bin.tar.gz[3.0.26^]) to address a vulnerability https://lists.apache.org/thread/y4nb9s4co34j8hdfmrshyl09lokm7356[CVE-2021-44521^].

As a result, we are advising 3.0 users to upgrade to 3.0.26; 3.11 users to upgrade to 3.11.12; and 4.0 users should upgrade to 4.0.3.
 
Please read the https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cassandra.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS.txt;hb=refs/tags/cassandra-4.0.3[release notes^] and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA[let us know^] if you encounter any problems.

Note: As the docs are not yet updated, the bintray location for Debian users is replaced with the https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/cassandra/[ASF's JFrog Artifactory location^].

See the xref:download.adoc[download section] for the latest stable and older supported versions of source and binary distributions.

To stay up-to-date, we recommend joining the Cassandra xref:community.adoc#discussions[mailing lists].

== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._

_Are you new to the project?  We have a handy xref:development/index.adoc[‚ÄòContributing to Cassandra‚Äô] page for how to get involved and get started. Additionally, we have established two boards you should take a look at if you are new to the project. One is a kanban board for https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=496&quickFilter=2252[‚ÄúFailing Tests‚Äù tickets that are unassigned^] and the other corresponds to our https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2162[Low Hanging Fruit or ‚ÄúStarter Tickets‚Äù^] for 4.0.x and 4.1.x. Feel free to self-select a ticket to work on._

_Any of these tickets should be of appropriate complexity for someone new to the project to tackle. Just remember to assign yourself to the ticket and acknowledge the status, such as ‚ÄòWork in Progress‚Äô and ‚ÄòNeeds Comitter/Patch Available‚Äô when you submit your patch. You can also reach out on the https://the-asf.slack.com/[ASF Slack^] in the #cassandra-dev Slack channel. Use @cassandra_mentors to contact our Cassandra mentors!_

Read PMC member Josh McKenzie‚Äôs https://lists.apache.org/thread/lnmw2b4hzkl977p9hxv1sbdfqlq5snc6[latest bi-weekly update^] for ongoing discussions and the latest on ticket progress.

=== Discussed

We are fast approaching 1 May and the cut of the next release, which will be Cassandra 4.1. At time of writing, this date is likely to be when features are frozen with a goal of GA on 1 July. 

*Note:* for this cycle only, we will continue to support 3.0 as well as the 3.11.latest, 4.0.latest, and 4.1.latest. See xref:blog/Behind-the-scenes-of-an-Apache-Cassandra-Release.adoc[Behind the Scenes of an Apache Cassandra Release] for more details.

=== Announced

The PMC is pleased to announce that *Aleksandr Sorokoumov* has https://lists.apache.org/thread/g45sbmbt29v8t29frn23mkldsb8g97of[accepted an invitation to become a committer] on the project. Aleksandr has been working on the project for a number of years and the honor is well deserved. üëè

=== Announced

Michael Larabel at Linux and hardware news site, Phoronix, has highlighted that https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/CAOUHufYFDawK6vmkQ16EQm7FSHresViifnxW2yj_RDuMSjJPjg@mail.gmail.com/T/#m7be5d832e631010bde7a2f5301013c3bed88e963[recent MGLRU benchmark test results^] for Apache Cassandra workloads indicate promising performance benefits. Multi-Gen LRU (MGLRU), developed by Google engineers, ‚Äúreworks how the Linux kernel's page reclamation code is handled,‚Äù says Larabel. ‚ÄúMGLRU has been showing to be a big improvement both for their internal workloads and by external parties testing the many public patch revisions.‚Äù For the full story read: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MGLRU-Not-For-5.18[MGLRU Could Land In Linux 5.19 For Improving Performance - Especially Low RAM Situations^].

=== Announced

Bloomberg has listed Apache Cassandra as one of the key technologies in its tech stack on its new https://t.co/7SjGBGGuKG[open source tech at Bloomberg site^], where it promotes and encourages open source contributions.

=== Announced

The ASF has a podcast channel called FeatherCast and in the interest of freshening up past Apache Cassandra contributions and promoting the project, *Sharan Foga* is https://lists.apache.org/thread/fnb1pnkn7jf64382y100w9tzkm3yn06t[kickstarting a new series of interviews^]. 

=== Announced

We need more volunteers for Build Lead. Thank you to the six people who have participated so far since we started the rotation, but we need more to sign up. You can learn more about the role on the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/DI3kCw[wiki page^] and the https://lists.apache.org/thread/kyyo5k3my2nx160mfgy0xkwo8xjh2qpv[related mailing list thread^]. 

=== Discussed

Worthy of references to greek mythology, *Stefan Miklosovic* took on the herculean (and  sisyphean) task of https://lists.apache.org/thread/pxc1hcz4hty8m6qfjp156mtqd1vmhz7t[cleaning up Cassandra‚Äôs GitHub PRs^]. This highlighted the need to discuss how PRs fit into the merge process, the right way to perform house-cleaning, and how we can document the process for future reference.

=== Discussed

For the latest on Cassandra‚Äôs journey to Java 17 support and whether it's likely to make it into 4.1, read https://lists.apache.org/thread/hny49r5vlg4nn9d53n3fksxvjg71joqz[*Ekaterina Dimitrova*‚Äôs update^].

=== Discussed 

A discussion continues on how to best use https://lists.apache.org/thread/qcys3do5p3g8gdb178l5ltfo35lf10ck[LinkedIn as a marketing channel^] for the project and around having multiple community groups on LinkedIn, some informal and some formally endorsed by the PMC. There is also discussion on how to best organize marketing and PR initiatives for Cassandra while retaining transparency in the process.

=== Discussed

*Benedict Elliott-Smith* has opened a thread on updating the Cassandra Code Style style guidance for contributors and supplied a https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjw0crb0clQin2tMgZLt_ob4hYfLJYaU4lRX722htTo/edit[working document^] for discussion.

=== Discussed

*Tibor R√©p√°si* has opened the discussion about the right next steps for our usage of the now deprecated https://lists.apache.org/thread/bc15lg79dl29q51w92nn2t0d2v7f5yvx[airlift/airline framework^] used in our CLI tools. The project restricts API breaking changes to Major releases only and qualify CLI output changes as API breaking as we can expect operational tooling to depend on formats for functionality.

=== Discussed

https://www.apachecon.com/acna2022/[ApacheCon North America 2022^] will take place on 3-6 October at the New Orleans Sheraton and there have been some discussion around Apache Cassandra CFPs, and participating in the new performance engineering track, but we will confirm details once they are official.

=== Discussed

Participation in https://lists.apache.org/thread/255nrv722vdq5yjpo2rwl48s90d8910d[Google Season of Docs for 2022 was discussed^], but the community has decided to pursue necessary preparations for participating next year.

=== Discussed

Apache Cassandra uses dtest (short for ‚Äòdistributed tests‚Äô) as an open source test suite and the community is discussing what framework to use and whether we should depreciate Python dtest in favor of the in-jvm dtest framework. You can join the discussion https://lists.apache.org/thread/0nqjj7r2yskkglw9lxxk7xgnpqcdf46r[here^].

== User Space

=== Logate

‚ÄúCassandra allows us to create systems that work in multiple data centers as one logical cluster. We meet customer demand for geographic redundancy, and can work in active-active, load-sharing mode across multiple data centers.‚Äù
