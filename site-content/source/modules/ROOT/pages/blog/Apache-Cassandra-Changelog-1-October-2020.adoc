image::blog/changelog_header.jpg[Apache Cassandra Changelog]
Our monthly roundup of key activities and knowledge to keep the community informed.

== Release Notes
=== Released

The most current Apache Cassandra releases are 4.0-beta2, 3.11.8, 3.0.22, 2.2.18 and 2.1.22 released on August 31 and are xref:download.adoc[in the repositories]. The next cut of releases will be out soon. 

Join the Cassandra xref:community.adoc#discussions[mailing list] to stay updated.

We continue to make progress toward the 4.0 GA release with the overarching goal of it being at a state where major users should feel confident running it in production when it is cut. Over 1,300 Jira tickets have been closed and https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/CASSANDRA/versions/12346094[less than 100,window=_blank] remain as of this post. To gain this confidence, there are various ongoing testing efforts involving correctness, performance, and ease of use.

=== Added

With CASSANDRA-15013, the community improved Cassandra's ability to xref:blog/Apache-Cassandra-Changelog-1-October-2020.adoc[handle high throughput workloads], while having enough safeguards in place to protect itself from potentially going out of memory.

=== Added

The https://github.com/apache/cassandra-harry/blob/master/README.md[Harry project,window=_blank] is a fuzz testing tool that aims to generate reproducible workloads that are as close to real-life as possible, while being able to efficiently verify the cluster state against the model without pausing the workload itself.

=== Added

The community published its first xref:blog/Apache-Cassandra-Usage-Report-2020.adoc[Apache Cassandra Usage Report 2020] detailing findings from a comprehensive global survey of 901 practitioners on Cassandra usage to provide a baseline understanding of who, how, and why organizations use Cassandra.

== Community Notes

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._

=== Added

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-7%3A+Storage+Attached+Index[CEP-7: Storage Attached Index (SAI),window=_blank] is a new secondary index for Cassandra that builds on the advancements made with SASI. It is intended to replace the existing built-in secondary index implementations.

=== Added

Cassandra was selected by the ASF Diversity & Inclusion committee to be https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfa1673c9f8b42cf286f5fb763eb987eced2bdea1a619358869a49bef%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[included in a research project,window=_blank] to evaluate and understand the current state of diversity.

=== Changed

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-2+Kubernetes+Operator[CEP-2: Kubernetes Operator,window=_blank] was introduced this year and is an active discussion on creation of a community-based operator with the goal of making it easy to run Cassandra on Kubernetes.

== User Space

=== Bigmate

"In vetting MySQL, MongoDB, and other potential databases for IoT scale, we found they couldn't match the scalability we could get with open source Apache Cassandra. Cassandra's built-for-scale architecture enables us to handle millions of operations or concurrent users each second with ease – making it ideal for IoT deployments." - https://www.iotcentral.io/blog/how-open-source-apache-cassandra-solved-our-iot-scalability-and-r[Brett Orr,window=_blank]

=== Bloomberg

"Our group is working on a multi-year build, creating a new Index Construction Platform to handle the daily production of the Bloomberg Barclays fixed income indices. This involves building and productionizing an Apache Solr-backed search platform to handle thousands of searches per minute, an Apache Cassandra back-end database to store millions of data points per day, and a distributed computational engine to handle millions of computations daily." - https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/meet-the-team-indices-engineering/[Noel Gunasekar,window=_blank]

A Cassandra user was in search of a tool to perform schema DDL upgrades. Another user suggested https://github.com/patka/cassandra-migration[https://github.com/patka/cassandra-migration,window=_blank] to ensure you don't get schema mismatches if running multiple upgrade statements in one migration. See the https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdfee145c4c5d920f644c6bcd081c6fb446d52b055c133485217b8143%40%3Cuser.cassandra.apache.org%3E[full email,window=_blank] on the user mailing list for other recommended tools.
