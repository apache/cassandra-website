=== Readers’/Editors’ Choice:  Top 3 Data and AI Open Source Projects To Watch
 
The BigDATAwire awards recognize companies and products that have made a difference in the big data community this year and provide insight into the state of the industry. The Apache Cassandra community was congratulated by the Managing Editor, Alex Woodie: “Congratulations to all of the winners of the 2022 Readers’ Choice Awards. Companies have a lot of product choices in the big data space today, but thanks to our dedicated readers, we know which ones have gained traction in the real world.”

This coveted award is a ringing endorsement of the collective and ongoing work of the Cassandra community and comes at an auspicious time as we expect to announce the General Availability (GA) of Apache Cassandra 4.1, the next major release from the project, very soon!

The eagerly awaited release of Cassandra 4.1 will offer exciting pluggability alongside features focused on better control, improved ease of use, and flexibility that benefits both developers and operators significantly.

The coveted annual BigDATAwire Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards are determined through a nomination and voting process with the global BigDATAwire community, as well as selections from the BigDATAwire editors.
