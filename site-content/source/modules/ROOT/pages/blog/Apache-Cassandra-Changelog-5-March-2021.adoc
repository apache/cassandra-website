Our monthly roundup of key activities and knowledge to keep the community informed.

== Release Notes
=== Released

We are expecting 4.0rc to be released soon, so join the Cassandra xref:community.adoc#join-the-conversation[mailing list,window=_blank] to stay up-to-date.

For the latest status on Cassandra 4.0 GA please check the https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=355&quickFilter=1661[Jira board,window=_blank] (ASF login required). We are within line-of-sight to closing out beta scope, with the remaining tickets representing 2.6% of the total scope. Read the latest summary from the community https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r353a9256a0cb27cffcaaf3e58df0a3bea3bd7373cc490f6646632d37%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[here,window=_blank].

=== Proposed

The community has been discussing https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re15543b55e5d01245ad75f7ec35af97e9895d37c01562eab31963dd4%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[release cadence,window=_blank] after 4.0 reaches GA. An official vote has not been taken on this yet, but the current consensus is one major release every year. Also under discussion are bleeding-edge snapshots (where stability is not guaranteed) and the duration of support for releases.

== Community Notes

=== Proposed

With 4.0 approaching completion, the idea of a project roadmap is also being https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r630675e184a3d8db66893c8206ea0bcb9adce62e97dfcb667e4e3438%40%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E[discussed,window=_blank].

A community website dedicated to https://github.com/datastax/cass-operator[cass-operator,window=_blank] is also in development focused on documentation for the operator. Going forward, the Kubernetes SIG is discussing release cadence and looking at six releases a year.

K8ssandra 1.0, an open source production-ready platform for running Apache Cassandra on Kubernetes, was also released on 25 February and announced on its new https://k8ssandra.io/[community website,window=_blank]. Read the https://k8ssandra.io/blog/2021/02/26/k8ssandra-1.0-stable-release-and-whats-next/[community blog,window=_blank] to find out more and what’s next. K8ssandra now has images for Cassandra 3.11.10 and 4.0-beta4 that run rootless containers with Reaper and Medusa functions.

== User Space

=== Instana

“The Instana components are already containerized and run in our SaaS platform, but we still needed to create containers for our databases, Clickhouse, Cassandra, etc., and set up the release pipeline for them. Most of the complexity is not in creating a container with the database running, but in the management of the configuration and how to pass it down in a maintainable way to the corresponding component.” - https://hackernoon.com/what-we-learned-by-dockerizing-our-applications-jk1y3xrx[Instana,window=_blank]

=== Flant

“We were able to successfully migrate the Cassandra database deployed in Kubernetes to another cluster while keeping the Cassandra production installation in a fully functioning state and without interfering with the operation of applications.” - https://medium.com/flant-com/migrating-cassandra-between-kubernetes-clusters-ae4ab4ada028[Flant,window=_blank]
