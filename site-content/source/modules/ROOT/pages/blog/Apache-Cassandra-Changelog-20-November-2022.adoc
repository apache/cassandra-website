== Release Notes

The first beta version of Apache Cassandra 4.1 (https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.1-beta1/[4.1-beta1^]) has been released. This is another milestone that brings us closer to the next major release of Cassandra. 

Please read the https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.1-beta1/NEWS.txt[release notes^] and feed back any problems you encounter.

In the interim, the latest release of Apache Cassandra is https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cassandra/4.0.7/apache-cassandra-4.0.7-bin.tar.gz[4.0.7^](https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.7/apache-cassandra-4.0.7-bin.tar.gz.asc[pgp^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.7/apache-cassandra-4.0.7-bin.tar.gz.sha256[sha256^], https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/4.0.7/apache-cassandra-4.0.7-bin.tar.gz.sha512[sha512^]), which was announced on 23 October 2022.

*Note:* For this release cycle only, we will continue to support Cassandra 3.0. as well as the latest patch versions of 3.11 and 4.0. See xref:blog/Behind-the-scenes-of-an-Apache-Cassandra-Release.adoc[Behind the Scenes of an Apache Cassandra Release] for more details.

See the xref:download.adoc[download section] for the latest stable and older supported versions of source and binary distributions. Please make sure you read the additional information on the Download page as the *Debian and RedHat package repositories have moved*.

To stay up-to-date, we recommend joining the  xref:community.adoc#discussions[Cassandra mailing lists].

== Community Notes for October

_Updates on Cassandra Enhancement Proposals (CEPs), how to contribute, and other community activities._ 

_For newcomers to the project, we have a useful xref:development/index.adoc[‘Contributing to Cassandra’] page for how to get involved and get started. We would also recommend reading the xref:doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.adoc[overview of the C* architecture]._

We use Jira to record project issues. Here’s a handy Jira tip from *Josh McKenzie*, if you want to search for tickets in your area of interest, use this https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20cassandra%20AND%20resolution%20!%3D%20unresolved%20AND%20assignee%20is%20EMPTY%20AND%20summary%20~%20%27ReplaceTextHere%27%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20ASC[URL link^]. Simply swap out ‘ReplaceTextHere’ in the URL query string for what you want to find.

_We also recommend viewing two Jira ticket queries we’ve created. One is a list of https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2160[unassigned tickets^] for 4.0.x or 4.x, covering things like documentation contributions and website contributions. The other is our list of https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=484&quickFilter=2160&quickFilter=2162[‘Starter Tickets’^] for 4.0.x and 4.1.x. These are tickets that have been determined by a mentor as being more manageable and good for getting to know the project. If you want to find a more challenging ticket just remove the ‘Start Tickets’ filter and dive in!_ 

_Just remember to assign yourself to the ticket and acknowledge the status, such as ‘Work in Progress’ and ‘Needs Comitter/Patch Available’ when you submit your patch. You can also reach out on the https://the-asf.slack.com/[ASF Slack^] in the *#cassandra-dev* Slack channel. We have 13 mentors ready to help, and you can contact them by using @cassandra_mentors._ 

_**Note:** We’ve become aware that ASF Slack has been made more secure to prevent excessive spam. To join the ASF Slack, you will need to send a message on the Cassandra mailing list so we can send you an invite._

_You can also read PMC member *Josh McKenzie’s* https://lists.apache.org/thread/csgwxhljw2z0vxmfw9pdztkh1rg7rt7g[latest bi-weekly update^] for ongoing discussions and the latest on ticket progress._

=== Announced

We are pleased to announce that the Cassandra Summit will return in 2023. You can read the https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Cassandra-Summit-Returns-in-2023.html[blog post^] for more details. The event will be held in San Jose, California on March 13-14 and hosted by the Linux Foundation. Call for Proposals are now open and you can read a guide on what is required on the official event site https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cassandra-summit/program/cfp/[here^]. If you would like to be a sponsor of this event, please email mailto:sponsorships@linuxfoundation.org[sponsorships@linuxfoundation.org].

=== Announced

There weren’t official recordings at ApacheCon NA this year, but Jeremy Hanna has kindly supplied footage that he took of many of the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tOhC7G2Ezp3W-SSs2J4CiLtlZ7hutuRP[Cassandra track presentations^]. Many of the talks were ground-breaking, so we are currently collecting slides and looking at recording the presentations again to enable us to upload them to YouTube.

=== Announced

A new episode of https://open.spotify.com/show/66VxpDTNUEoU1SgyvvOQKw[Apache Cassandra Corner^] has been released! Episode 11 is an interview with PMC Chair, *Mick Semb Weaver* and his journey into open source, life at The Last Pickle and what’s involved in being the PMC Chair. Host, *Aaron Ploetz* has announced that the next episode will be with *Derek Chen-Becker*, AWS Senior Engineer and open source developer.

=== Announced

Thanks to *Stefano Lottini*, we have added a dedicated xref:events.adoc[Events] page to the Cassandra website. As you may have noticed, Cassandra Summit has returned and we have frequent city-based Cassandra Days in the calendar now. This has meant we needed a special page to promote events away from the technical focus of the Cassandra blog.

=== Discussed

*Derek Chen-Becker* has opened a discussion refactoring the CircleCI configuration and bringing it to parity with Jenkins. If you want to help or contribute to the discussion, you can find the mailing list thread https://lists.apache.org/thread/mvql1p5y2j7so18427zcg4zxc9vzl7l3[here^].

=== Discussed

*Josh McKenzie* https://lists.apache.org/thread/26gw66ohl8zbo4ozj3yvhk19wkzl0qw0[started a discussion^] on revising the release gating criteria and CI systems. The conclusion of that conversation was a vote that was passed, allowing either ASF Jenkins or CircleCI as release gating criteria for official Cassandra releases. This is an interim measure while the project continues work to improve the stability of the ASF CI infrastructure.

=== Discussed

*Mick Semb Wever* has been leading a discussion on https://lists.apache.org/thread/ymj3737x25b7bbqv9lp27w5v1ftc83j9[making release 4.2 into 5.0.^] This has been agreed by consensus. The thread has been discussing the distinctions between majors and minors and whether or not they are required.

=== Discussed

The discussion on https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/QoueDQ[CEP-24: Password validation and generation^], started by Stefan Miklosovic, has progressed to cover what operators to use and the industry standards. You can add to the discussion on the https://lists.apache.org/thread/454tmo2r9238rj69j7h3xv43crygv31m[mailing list^].

=== Discussed

The conversation, led by Branimir Lambov, on including the Agrona library, which is dependency of the new Trie memtable implementation, has reached a consensus. While the Agrona library will be included, it did lead to a discussion on the dangers of overlapping functionality and the need to document the Cassandra way to approach adding dependencies to the code-base where you have multiple first-class options. You can follow the discussion https://lists.apache.org/thread/zk9hjk1rklcof1pmw555no032pmr3001[here^].

=== Discussed

*Brad Schoening* is continuing to help us modernize CQLSH and our https://lists.apache.org/thread/14wlyv2skmkn6jlg9ojh134c3p20ypg8[use of Python^]. This time to bring awareness to an upgrade from optparse to argparse to remove dependencies on deprecated classes and components, which was quickly approved.

=== Discussed

*Berenguer Blasi* is looking for feedback on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-14227[CASSANDRA-14227^] on extending the maximum expiration timestamp date that can be represented by the storage engine. If you have a perspective on this, join the discussion thread https://lists.apache.org/thread/j36ps2tsjjchfm1msl3v8xghox1djgyt[here^] or chime in directly into the ticket.

== User Space

=== Capital One

Senior Director at Capital One, David Harmony, explaining why the American bank holding company uses Apache Cassandra:

[quote,'https://www.cio.com/article/350288/becoming-a-fintech-capital-ones-move-from-mainframes-to-the-cloud.html[Capital One^]']

“One of the bigger advantages of Cassandra is resilience. Since Cassandra leans towards AP in CAP Theorem, it can manage partition failures to remain available round-the-clock. Cassandra’s masterless, peer-to-peer architecture ensures that applications never experience downtime even during disastrous system failures.”
