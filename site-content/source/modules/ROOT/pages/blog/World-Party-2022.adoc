As we near the release of Apache Cassandra 4.1, we are excited to announce the second annual https://www.cassandraworldparty.org/[Apache Cassandra™ World Party^] (CWP) on *Wednesday, July 20, 2022*.

=== What is the event?

CWP is a special one-day event that brings together the global community for a fun and fast-paced virtual gathering that reflects who we are in all its diversity. 

To make CWP accessible to as many people as possible, we will run three, one-hour virtual sessions across three different time zones at the following times:

* July 20 1200 UTC
* July 20 1800 UTC
* July 21 0100 UTC

=== Submit a talk!

To make it as easy as possible for anyone in the community to get involved, the format for the talks is very simple:

* Each talk is only five minutes long (lightning talks!) 
* Each speaker has five slides that automatically advance every minute. 
* Talks can be in the language of the speaker’s choice. English is not required.

Talk topics can range on anything related to Cassandra: the new Cassandra 4.1 release; what you love about the database; how you’ve contributed; what you’ve learned; or what you’ve built with Cassandra. 

The goal of the talks is to share Cassandra knowledge and experiences with everyone in the community.

To submit your talk, head to the CFP portal here: https://sessionize.com/apache-cassandra-4-1-world-party/[Sessionize page^] before the closing date of Sunday, June 19 at 11:59 pm PT / 6:59 UTC.

For a chance to meet up in person, we are also running local watch parties in major cities that will cover all the time zones.

Apache Cassandra has a lot to celebrate, and we look forward to seeing you at CWP in July!
