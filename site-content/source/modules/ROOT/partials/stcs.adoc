= SizeTieredCompactionStrategy (STCS)

The default compaction strategy.
This strategy triggers a minor compaction when there are a number of similar sized SSTables on disk as configured by the table subproperty, min_threshold.
A minor compaction does not involve all the tables in a keyspace.
Also see _STCS compaction subproperties_ in the relevant CQL documentation.
