= zombie

A row or cell that reappears in a database table after deletion.
This can happen if a node goes down for a long period of time and is then restored without being repaired.

Deleted data is not erased from database tables; it is marked with <<tombstone,tombstones>> until compaction.
The tombstones created on one node must be propagated to the nodes containing the deleted data.
If one of these nodes goes down before this happens, the node may not receive the most up-to-date tombstones.
If the node is not repaired before it comes back online, the database finds the non-tombstoned items and propagates them to other nodes as new data.

To avoid this problem, run nodetool repair on any restored node before rejoining it to its cluster.
