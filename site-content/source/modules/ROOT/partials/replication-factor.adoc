= replication factor (RF)

The total number of replicas across the cluster, abbreviated as RF.
A replication factor of 1 means that there is only one copy of each row in the cluster.
If the node containing the row goes down, the row cannot be retrieved.
A replication factor of 2 indicates two copies of each row and that each copy is on a different node.
All replicas are equally important;
there is no primary or master replica.
