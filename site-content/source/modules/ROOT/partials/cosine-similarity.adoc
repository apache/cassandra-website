= cosine similarity

A metric measuring the similarity between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It quantifies the cosine of the angle between the vectors; the angle representing each vector's orientation and direction relative to each other. Zero (0) indicates complete dissimilarity. Negative one (-1) indicates exact opposite orientation of the vectors. One (1) indicates complete similarity.
