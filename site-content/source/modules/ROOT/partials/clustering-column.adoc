= clustering column

In the table definition, a clustering column is a column that is part of the compound primary key definition.
Note that the clustering column *cannot* be the first column because that position is reserved for the <<partition key>>.
Columns are clustered in multiple rows within a single partition.
The clustering order is determined by the position of columns in the compound primary key definition.
