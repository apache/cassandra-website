= embeddings

A mathematical technique in machine learning where complex, high-dimensional data is represented as points in a lower-dimensional space. The process of creating an embedding preserves the relevant properties of the original data, such as distance and similarity, enabling easier computational processing. For instance, words with similar meanings in Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be set close to each other in the reduced space, facilitating their use in machine learning models.
