= eventual consistency

The database maximizes availability and partition tolerance.
The database ensures eventual data <<consistency>> by updating all replicas during read operations and periodically checking and updating any replicas not directly accessed.
The updating and checking ensures that any query always returns the most recent version of the result set and that all replicas of any given row eventually become completely consistent with each other.
