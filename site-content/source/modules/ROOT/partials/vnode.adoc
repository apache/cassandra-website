= Vnode

Vnode is a virtual node.
Normally, nodes are responsible for a single partitioning range in the full token range of a cluster.
With vnodes enabled, each node is responsible for several virtual nodes, effectively spreading a partitioning range across more nodes in the cluster.
Enabling vnodes can reduce the risk of hotspotting or straining one node in the cluster.
