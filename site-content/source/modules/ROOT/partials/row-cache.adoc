= row cache

A database component for improving the performance of read-intensive operations.
In off-heap memory, the row cache holds the most recently read rows from the local <<SSTable,SSTables>>.
Each local read operation stores its result set in the row cache and sends it to the coordinator node.
The next read first checks the row cache.
If the required data is there, the database returns it immediately.
This initial read can save further seeks in the Bloom filter, partition key cache, partition summary, partition index, and SSTables.

The database uses LRU (least-recently-used) eviction to ensure that the row cache is refreshed with the most frequently accessed rows.
The size of the row cache can be configured in the cassandra.yaml file.
