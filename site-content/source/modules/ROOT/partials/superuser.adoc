= superuser

Superuser is a role attribute that provides root database access.
Superusers have all permissions on all objects.
Apache Cassandra databases include the superuser role `cassandra` with password `cassandra` by default.
This account runs queries, including logins, with a consistency level of `QUORUM`.
It is recommended that users create a superuser for deployments and remove the `cassandra` role.
