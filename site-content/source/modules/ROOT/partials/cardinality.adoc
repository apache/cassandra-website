= cardinality

The number of unique values in a column.
For example, a column of ID numbers unique for each employee would have high cardinality while a column of employee ZIP codes would have low cardinality because multiple employees can have the same ZIP code.

An index on a column with low cardinality can boost read performance because the index is significantly smaller than the column.
An index for a high-cardinality column may reduce performance.
If your application requires a search on a high-cardinality column, a materialized view is ideal.
