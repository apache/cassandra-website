= LeveledCompactionStrategy (LCS)

This compaction strategy creates SSTables of a fixed, relatively small size that are grouped into levels.
Within each level, SSTables are guaranteed to be non-overlapping.
Each level (L0, L1, L2, and so on) is ten times as large as the previous level.
Disk I/O is more uniform and predictable on higher levels than on lower levels as SSTables are continuously being compacted into progressively larger levels.
At each level, row keys are merged into non-overlapping SSTables in the next level.
This process improves performance for reads because the database can determine which SSTables in each level to check for the existence of row key data.
