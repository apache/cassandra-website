= linearizable consistency

Also called _serializable consistency_, linearizable consistency is the restriction that one operation cannot be executed unless and until another operation has completed.

The database supports Lightweight transactions to ensure linearizable consistency in writes.
The first phase of a Lightweight transaction works at SERIAL consistency and follows the Paxos protocol to ensure that the required operation succeeds.
If this phase succeeds, the write is performed at the consistency level specified for the operation.
Reads performed at the SERIAL consistency level execute without database built-in read repair operations.
