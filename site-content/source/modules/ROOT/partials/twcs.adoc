= TimeWindowCompactionStrategy (TWCS)

This compaction strategy compacts SSTables based on a series of time windows.
During the current time window, the SSTables are compacted into one or more SSTables.
At the end of the current time window, all SSTables are compacted into a single larger SSTable.
The compaction process repeats at the start of the next time window.
Each TWCS time window contains data within a specified range and contains varying amounts of data.
