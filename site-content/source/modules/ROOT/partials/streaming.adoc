= streaming

A component that handles data exchange among nodes in a cluster.
It is part of the SSTable file.  +

Examples include:

* When bootstrapping a new node, the new node gets data from existing nodes using streaming.
* When running nodetool repair, nodes exchange out-of-sync data using streaming.
* When bulkloading data from backup, sstableloader uses streaming to complete a task.
